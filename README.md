# Sonar Data Classification using Logistic Regression

## Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model to classify sonar signals as either a "Rock" or a "Mine" based on sonar data. The dataset used consists of 208 samples, each with 60 features representing sonar signals.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset, which can be found in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connectionist+Bench+(Sonar,+Mines+vs.+Rocks)). 

### Data Structure
- **Total Samples:** 208
- **Features:** 60 continuous values representing sonar signal strength.
- **Target Variable:** 
  - **R:** Rock
  - **M:** Mine

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn:** For building and evaluating the logistic regression model.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository or download the dataset.
2. Ensure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
   ```
3. Run the analysis script:
   ```bash
   python sonar_classification.py
   ```
## Model Training
 1. The dataset is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame and explored to understand its structure and statistical properties.
 2. The data is split into training and testing sets (90% training, 10% testing) while maintaining the distribution of the classes.
 3. A logistic regression model is trained on the training dataset.
## Results
- **Training Accuracy:** ~85.03%
- **Testing Accuracy:** ~61.90%

## Making Predictions
The model can also make predictions based on new input data. An example of how to input data and get predictions is included in the code. For example:

   ```python
   input_data = (0.0090, 0.0062, 0.0253, ...)
   ```
The model predicts whether the input data corresponds to a Rock or Mine.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a logistic regression model for binary classification using sonar data. The model's performance can be improved with more advanced techniques or by using different algorithms.

## Future Work
- Experiment with other classification algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM).
- Tune model hyperparameters for improved accuracy.
- Incorporate cross-validation for more robust evaluation.
